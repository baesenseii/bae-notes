```
red@ops:~/$ whoami

-> Known as BaeSenseii (used to be called xxbaemaxx, but it kinda sounds dumb)
-> "Once a techie, always a technie"
-> Worked in the cybersecurity industry, now an academic teaching cybersecurity.
-> Constantly reading up on new tech, and their flaws :)
```

- This is quite frankly my first time blogging and recording my research content (after procrastinating for so long)
- Mainly focusing on CTF challenges, and also other stuffs/thoughts on other matters (maybe cybersecurity specific, could be pedagogy specific too, so... :))
- To navigate, feel free to look on the left hand sidebar (under 'Explorer') for more information.
	- If you can't see the sidebar, zoom out of your web browser (80% worked for me).
